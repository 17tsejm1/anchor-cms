<h1>Theming Anchor</h1>
<p>Theming Anchor CMS aims to be easy.</p>

<h2>The files</h2>
<p>A theme for Anchor requires two files:</p>
<ul>
	<li>index.php</li>
	<li>sub.php</li>
	<li>about.txt</li>
</ul>

<small>Note: the search.php file is also required if your site uses a search feature.</small>

<p>There are a number of optional files you can also include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>includes/header.php</li>
	<li>includes/footer.php</li>
	<li>posts.php</li>
	<li>404.php</li>
</ul>

<p>So what do all of these files do? As the building blocks of your Anchor site, they do quite a lot.</p>

<dl>
	<dt id="page-about">about.txt <em>required</em></dt>
		<dd>The metadata for your theme. It has its <a href="#metadata">own simple syntax</a>, and is required to show as an available theme in the admin panel.</dd>

	<dt id="page-index">index.php <em>required</em></dt>
		<dd>The source for the homepage/index page of Anchor. Unlike Wordpress, this is not the fallback page (<a href="#page-sub">sub.php</a> is).</dd>
	
	<dt>sub.php <em>required</em></dt>
		<dd>The default page for subpages, and the fallback file for non-included files: if you don't have a <a href="#page-posts">posts.php</a> file, for example, it will try to load the sub.php file instead.</dd>
